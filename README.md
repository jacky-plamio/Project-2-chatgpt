# Project 2 -Chatgpt
Outside the grid - chatgptprompts

Approaching this assignment, the first step was choosing a topic of choice. Although the assignment mentioned that the content wasn't really the important aspect, I wanted to choose something that I would continue to develop after the assessment as it is an area of interest. I chose to create a website for a fictional coffee supplier company named Kohi Supply Co..Although technically a type of shop website, my aim for this was to highlight the company and their story within the homepage. When doing some research, I noticed how many coffee supplier companies and their websites had a lot of content just on the first page of contact that included their stories or about them, their products, history, etc. They had multiple sections within the homepage and so I took inspo from that and moved slightly away from my original idea of just creating something minimal with a hero image and call for action approach in the center. Here are a few inspo site layouts.

### Using ChatGPT

This assignment was my first chance to explore a little bit of using chatgpt. It was very surprising how fast and accurate? it generated the responses. In terms of using this for this assignment, I think the most use i found in it was creating the general structure and little aspects that I still needed help with. My first prompt I asked "Create a complete website for a coffee supplier company using html", which was a general prompt that i knew from previous examples would generate a basic structure. But I was also just amazed at how it continued to generate for each pages. Continuing on from generating more prompts, I did notice how you really had to be very specific about what you needed and if you don't know what you want in terms of design or structure aspects, it will only generate limited response. I think when you struggle with the creative aspects of the assignment, relying on chatgpt to help generate a website for you, will only help you to a certain point. I did struggle with the creative aspect but I did know certain things I wanted to include. Here is the link to my chat - https://chat.openai.com/c/69e1c042-55b8-40f6-9b38-de36ea4a309c


### Design Choices and struggles

For this assignment, I wanted to create a header and navigation that was centred. I feel like it suits the company personality of a coffee supplier, not that that matters but that was my reason for having centered header/navbar instead of many other general websites. I created a simple logo first and based the colour pallete for this website which I tried to incorporate in the banner with the motto as well as the footer. I also took some feedback from the previous assessment and realised that I was making my css styling repetetive especially when it came to specifying font styles and sizes for each sections which I did just target the bodyas a whole. With the hero component, I tried to include a video instead of a still image which worked well for my design, I think it brings the landing page together and suits the centered header. At first I was unsure and struggled with the styling because the video appeared so large and way bigger than the viewport but after fixing the widths it was fine. One of my biggest struggle at the very start was 1. I kept restarting as I did not like the way it was looking, 2. I made such a simple mistake of not linking my css correctly as I overlooked it after copying the code that chatgpt generated in the initial response. It took a while but we got there and I could actually see  the changes being made. I think that was the biggest lesson, it was easy to overlook and chatgpt will provide the basic structures but you really do have to check and confirm each line of code even if it looks correct.
