      <h3>Roasting</h3>
      <p>Green coffee beans are roasted to bring out their unique flavors, aromas, and characteristics. Roasting is a skillful process that involves carefully applying heat to transform the beans from green to various degrees of roast, such as light, medium, or dark.</p>

      <h3>Grinding</h3>
      <p> Roasted coffee beans are ground into smaller particles to increase the surface area, allowing for better extraction of flavors during brewing. The grind size varies depending on the brewing method, such as coarse for French press or fine for espresso.</p>

      <h3>Packaging</h3>
      <p>The final stage is brewing, where the coffee grounds are combined with hot water to extract the desired flavors and create the aromatic beverage. Different brewing methods, such as drip brewing, espresso machines, or manual pour-over, offer distinct taste experiences.</p>
